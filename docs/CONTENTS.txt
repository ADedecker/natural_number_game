Directories:

docs: informational documents

experiments: possible future levels, e.g. primality, factorials, binominal coefficients, gcd, congruence

levels: an early version of the game written in plain Lean so I could
test things easily in VS Code. No longer supported.

src/game: The Lean code for the worlds in the game, plus some LaTeX used to generate the diagrams because it was easier than figuring out how to make a LaTeX diagrams package work in this set-up.

world1 = Tutorial World
world2 = basic addition world
world3 = basic multiplication world
world4 = power world
world5 is now function world
world6 proposition world but we have 0 levels
world7 advanced prop world
world8 is then advanced addition world
world9 advanced multiplcation world
world10 inequality world (17 levels so far, but more have been written)

src/mynat: the definitions of the naturals, addition, multiplication, exponentiation and <=. These files are never seen by the user.

src/tactic: the modifications of the tactic framework (meaning that rw and induction and a couple of other things behave slightly differently -- see docs/technical.md for more explanation of this) and the definition of `structure_helper`, a tactic which attempts to fill fields of a class by attempting to define field `F` with `mynat.F`.

compile.sh, run_locally.sh, ship.sh -- these won't work for you.
Local scripts which run on my machine to compile, run the code
locally, and to ship it to the web server.

leanpkg.toml -- settings file for this Lean project.

game_config.toml -- settings file for Lean game maker (the graph of the game).
