Directories:

docs: informational documents

experiments: possible future levels, e.g. primality, factorials, binominal coefficients, gcd, congruence

levels: an early version of the game written in plain Lean so I could
test things easily in VS Code.

src/game: The Lean code for the worlds in the game, plus some LaTeX used to generate the diagrams because it was easier than figuring out how to make a LaTeX diagrams package work in this set-up.

world1 = Tutorial World
world2 = basic addition world
world3 = basic multiplication world
world4 = power world
world5 is now function world
world6 proposition world but we have 0 levels
world7 advanced prop world
world8 is then advanced addition world
world9 advanced multiplcation world
world10 inequality world (17 levels so far, but more have been written)
