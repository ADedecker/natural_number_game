  (feel free to write it, anyone!)

The natural numbers has this hideous "computer science natural number `subtraction`" which is far less well behaved than integer subtraction -- they define it so that `2 - 7 = 0` and more generally all negative numbers are mapped to zero. There are inqualities eveyywhere. 

Type
`#print prefix nat`
into Lean, click on the display that appears, and then do ctrl-F and search for sub. There are loads of lemmas. I think it's all a bit boring though. Is this worth doing? I don't think you get any new instances this way, which is some sort of an indication that mathematicians don't care.
